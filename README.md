This is a Website to Test my Beginner Coding Skills in HTML & CSS. 
The website created is a site documenting the History of the Apartheid System in South Africa

Key to look at is the HTML/CSS code used, the techniques involved, the file structure and the Images selection and Original text I developed.

The site was created in 2020.
