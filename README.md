This is a Project to Test - how to use GitHub and Codespaces - The Repository consists of a few pages from a Website I created using an Introduction to Coding Book, in 2020. 

The website created is a site documenting the History of the Apartheid System in South Africa.  

I have only added a few pages and images from the site, as this was all that was needed to help figure out how to create a repository, add new files, create a codespace, work on and edit the project as well as how to version control and commit changes to the project.
