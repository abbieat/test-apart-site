<p>The reasoning that led to Apartheid was always present from the original landing
of the Dutch. It developed into a set constitution and strict government policy
because the white minority poplation once they had established themselves in the land 
wanted to ensure they would hold onto
ruling power.  The threat was the non-white majority, who
were considered less than, and were universally treated 
poorly helped by the spread of slavery globally. </p>


<h2> Pre-History - 1812: Initial Relations </h2> 

<p> The KhoiSan and the Bantu had managed to settle together without either group
causing each other mass disturbance. Some of these groups were involved in their
own intertribal conflicts within the two groupings. </p> 
<br/>
<p>Early on the Dutch had tried to trade with the KhoiKhoi and San bushmen they found when they passed
by South Africa on their way to the East.
These were two very different cultures and the KhoiSan were not capitalistic and
weren't particularly interested in 
trading with the Dutch. Eventually the Dutch decided they would set up a colony
and provide replenishments for themselves without the aid or inteference of the KhoiKhoi.</p>
The issues began when the Dutch began to take over land used by KhoiKhoi herders. The Khoikhoi
found themselves unable to use land they considered theirs. The Khoikhoi and the Dutch fought, and the Dutch drove out the Khoikhoi. 
The Khoikhoi also died in large numbers due to
lack of immunity to smallpox brought by the Dutch.  Already at this point, the Dutch viewed
the Khoikhoi as inferiors and the Dutch accustomed to European slavery and its 
teachings were primed to dismiss and avoid natives.  This was the intial reasoning that paved the way for racial segregation, race bias and
eventually apartheid. </p>


<h2> 1812-1900: Moving towards Apartheid </h2> 

<p>The French Huegeunots who formed part of the Dutch Cape Colony settlement presented the idea of non-mixing.
The Dutch settlers, who became known as Afrikaners adopted this policy also. 
Slavery was also a part of Cape Society and the laws employed to maintain control of slaves meant 
that a clear distinction was made based on race, and slaves were kept in their position through 
emphasising racism. 
After the British and the Dutch fought,they did not want Zulu or other Bantu tribes to see
that as an opportunity to reclaim land, they decided something had to be done. There was talk of
establishing segregated policies. The whites had already ensured no black/coloured/indian could be a representative
in parliament, non-whites were not effectively heard or listened to.
</p><br/>
<p> Economic considerations and maintaining white dominance was also a key reason why racial segregation and later 
Apartheid was brought in.
In the 1900s white people of British origin were wealthy,primarily from commerce such as
diamond and gold mining, evidenced by British figures such as Cecil Rhodes. In contrast most Afrikaners, that
is Dutch settlers, typically farmers by occupation, were poor. 
Poor whites had to compete with blacks in the urban economy and blacks being the majority and considered
slightly cheaper to recruit would have dominated. Afrikaners formed 55% of the electorate however
and their concerns could not be ignored by politicians looking to stay in power. Laws therefore
were introduced to help Afrikaners succeed and keep blacks out of employment and citizenship. </p>

<h2>1900-1948: Creation of Laws</h2>
<p> A raft of discrimnatory legislation was already in place before Apartheid was officially introduced in 1948.
Apartheid simply updated the racist policies and sentiments that were a key part of South Africa pre-1948.  
The type of laws passed during what is known as the racial segregation era include:</p>

<br/>
<ul>

<li>The Mines and Works Act 1911 - this reserved certain jobs in mining and railways for white workers.</li>
<li> The Immorality Act 1927 - under Apartheid this became the Immorality Amendment Act 1950, both laws preventing 
whites from marrying or having relations with non-whites.</li>
<li>The Natives Land Act 1913 - this restricted land ownership by black people to 8% of the land area of South Africa. 
The areas chosen for black habitation became known as reserves, or bantustans - land of the Bantus.
It also prohibited any purchase or lease of land by blacks outside the reserves.</li>
<li>Pass laws which were already a feature of Cape slavery were also brought in, limiting the movement of non-whites,
preventing them from leaving the reserves without a pass, usually only issued for work 
purposes.</li>
<li> Laws prohibiting political involvement were also a part of the discrimination laws.
Non-whites were not allowed to vote or have effective political representation. This was highligted even from
the Constitution drawn up in 1908. The Constitution consisted of 4 principles, principle 1 being that Parliament 
was sovereign, and principle 2, to be a member of Parliament one had to be a white male. From the 
outset therefore non-whites were not able to voice or pass laws to improve their status or living.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1948-1994:Apartheid becomes official </h2>
<p>In 1948, the National Party won the election and set up Apartheid.They researched this policy and made it their manifesto.
When they won, they simply installed the policy they had promised to, called Apartheid.  
Segregation was already enforced but it now became national policy
and even more clearly delineated. Parliament ruled by white South Africans decided
all blacks, coloured, indian were to be denied voting rights, quality education, and were placed in poor housing.</p>

<p> Some of the key apartheid policies that were pursued includes:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li> The Population Registration Act 1950 - this required that every South African be registered
according to the race classification they belonged to, decided by the government. This allowed them
to decide what services and what standard of service you were entitled to based on your
grouping. </li>
<li> The Reservation of Seperate Amenities Act 1953 - this allowed public premises,
vehicles and services to be segregated by race, even if equal facilities were not made available to all
races. </li>
<li> Laws reserving well-paying jobs for whites and preventing natives from
forming unions or campaigning for better conditions were passed. This included Mines and Works Act 1911,
Native labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act 1953 and Industrial Conciliation Act 1956. Here you see the
effect of business lobbying on the laws governemnt passed. </li>
<li> Laws were passed segregating education, and lowering the quality of the education
available to non-whites. This included the Bantu Education Act 1953 and the Indians Education
Act 1965.</li>
<li> Laws preventing marriages or relations between whites and non-whites, Prohibition of 
Mixed Marriages Act 1949. Immorality Amendment Act 1950. </li>
<li> Laws allotting the best land to whites and giving the remaining majority population
the remaining unwanted land. Geographical segregation was also brought in, 
with each race given certain areas to live and prohibted from entering other areas, 
enshrined in The Group Areas Act 1950. From 1960ï¿½1983, 3.5 million Non-White 
South Africans were removed from their homes and forced 
into black or coloured neighbourhoods, considered one of the largest mass evictions in modern history. </li>
<li> Apartheid laws were also passed to revoke the citizenship of black South Africans. These 
laws included The Bantu Authorities Act 1951, The Bantu Homelands Development Corporations
Act 1965, The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act 1970 - these laws made black people citizens
of one of the ten bantustans (black reserves), with the intention that when the Bantustans
became independent the inhabitans would cease to be South African citizens. None of these
bantustans ever became recognised outside South Africa as independent states. </li>
<li> Laws banning political assembly, detention without trial and state security
were also a key feature of apartheid. These laws included 
Suppression of Communism Act 1950, Riotous Assemblies Act 1956, Unlawful Organizations Act 1960
and Terrorism Act 1967.</li>
</ul>

<p>By 1982 Apartheid was firmly entrenched. It became an increasingly callous and vicious regime, culminating
in events such as the Soweto Uprising. The clear racist and imperialist attitude held by the white 
South African leaders showed them unfit to be effective leaders. 
Within South Africa and worldwide campaigning demanded an end to 
South Africas brutalistic regime.</p>
