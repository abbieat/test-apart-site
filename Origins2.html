<p>To understand the origins of Apartheid, it helps to grasp the 
history of the different people groups that settled in South Africa.</p>


<h2> Pre-history to 500CE : The Khoisan Population</h2> 

<p>The original peoples who lived in the area now known as South Africa were San hunter-gatherers and Khoikhoi 
herder-pastoralists. They came to be referred to collectively as the KhoiSan. They are the earliest known inhabitants 
of South Africa, and they inhabited the coastal and interior areas of South Africa.</p>

<h2>300CE to 1400s: The Bantu Peoples are established in South Africa</h2>
<p>Around 300-500CE, Bantu peoples, darker skinned Africans compared to the KhoiSan, arrive in 
South Africa from the North and East of Africa as part of the Bantu migration, 
some of the Bantu intermarry with the KhoiSan forming new KhoiSan Bantu peoples,
but the KhiSan are mostly pushed to the Cape coastline, or into the Khalahari in the north.</p>

<p> As they establish themselves, various tribes of Bantu peoples emerge in South Africa,mainly,
 the Nguni peoples (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Ndebele tribes), the Sotho-Tswana peoples (Tswana, Pedi, BaSotho tribes),
 the Venda, Lemba and Tsonga peoples.</p>

<h2>1600s to 1994: European Contact with South Africa leading to Colonisation and Apartheid </h2>
<p> The Portugese had earlier discovered South Africa in 1488 but did not seek to conquer it. In 1652 the Dutch through 
their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company"> Dutch East India Company (the VOC) </a> arrive to 
set up a small colony on the Cape to serve as a replenishment station for their ships and sailors 
on their way to their trade stations in Asia.</p>

<br/>

<p>This small colony, called the Dutch Cape Colony slowly grew. Initially the Dutch took over land in the Cape area 
that was used by the KhoiSan people, driving them out using perimeters and weapons. Not being able to get many of the 
KhoiSan to work for them, the Dutch also imported slaves from Malaysia, Madagascar and Mozambique, 
these become the group termed the Coloured People, who to this day mostly
live in the Cape area to which they were first brought. The remaining KhoiSan in the area
will be grouped with these slave groups in later years by the white minority government and will also be included
in the Coloured People grouping. </p>

<p>In the 1840s, Some of the Dutch farmers from the Cape colony, later to be refered to as booers, leave the Cape Colony
in order to gain more freedom. The Dutch farmers are fleeing the overly authoritarian Dutch East India Company and the British government's 
inteference, namely their abolition of slavery which the Dutch farmers disagreed with.  As the Dutch farmers journey
further into the interior of the country, they take over land they see as useful, this caused conflict with those 
who already considered the land theirs. A system of pushing the KhoiSan and Bantu natives out of their
land arose, with the Dutch using superior war technology to overcome the established occupants.  The British also would 
take part in driving out natives in the interior from their land. </p>

<div class="indent">
<p> From the beginning the Cape society had a racially stratified society, blacks and whites did not mix and 
natives were seen as inferior and kept in low status jobs. </p>
<p> The British had installed themselves in South Africa since 1803 taking over the Dutch Cape Colony
as a strategic trading post during the Napoleonic Wars. The British and the Dutch
fight in a series of wars known by the British as the Boer Wars 1899-1902, but the two groups are united when it comes
to viewing natives as less than, not to be accorded full rights with whites and to be kept
seperate and lower status.</p>

<p>In the 1800s unable to recruit black workers, the British brought Indian workers from British colonial
Asia.

<p> By 1912, we find the South African people we know today, 12% white, 75% Black Native, 4% Indian, 9% 
Coloured (includes KhoiSan people).  This is important to know as a key part of why apartheid developed
was the white peoples awareness that they were a minority. We also see the orignial dwellers and the 
various other people groups who came to have a stake in the land.</p>
<br/>

<p>  By 1920, the white people in SOuth Africa, made up primarily of Dutch and British peoples
had installed themselves in the land. Taking over fertile areas and subjugating the local peoples, they also found
gold and diamonds in the interior, making South Africa a lucrative country to possess. 
Finding themselves in a good position, the whites, their leaders
determined to hold on to their power, especially as they 
saw what they perceived as a threat to
their ability to make money, which was blacks pouring into the new towns, competing with poor whites
for jobs which the blacks were likely to get. Whites were also keenly aware that they were
a minority and could be pushed out if natives were to unite and decide against them.
The whites therefore saw a need to ensure continued
white dominance and survival.  </p>
